        Introduction
        ============
        
        This tool provides easily readable "pictures" of protein conformations, 
        ensembles, and trajectories saved as either a combined protein databank 
        (PDB) structure file, or a directory of such files, and produces graphs.
        
        BackMAP helps with the visualization of large amounts of structural (space-time) backbone data in a single graph.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        PIP Installation
        -----------------
        
        Running the following at command line would get the job done (the '-I' is not necessary, but ensures the latest sub-version is installed):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install -I backmap
        
        
        GIT Installation
        ----------------
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/ranjanmannige/backmap.git
            $ cd backmap
            $ python setup.py install
            $ python setup.py test
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        In-script usage
        ---------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import backmap as bm
            print bm.R(phi=0,psi=0) # Should print '0.5'
        
        For more information about in-script module usage, refer to the `manuscript <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjanmannige/backmap/master/manuscript/manuscript/plotmap.pdf>`_ associated with this module.
        
        Standalone usage
        ----------------
        
        After installation, the following commands produce a variety of graphs (exampled below).
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            python -m backmap -pdb ./pdbs/ProteinDatabankStructureFilename.pdb
            python -m backmap -pdb /directory/containing/pdbs/
            
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Example 1: A stable protein (`1xqq <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1XQQ>`_)
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The Panels **(b)** through **(f)** were created by running the following command within thin the downloaded directory (Panel **(a)** was created using `VMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_).
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            python -m backmap -pdb ./tests/pdbs/1xqq.pdb
        
        As evident below, the graphs generated from the protein ensemble `1xqq <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1XQQ>`_ describes a conformationally stable protein (each graph is detailed below). 
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjanmannige/backmap/master/manuscript/manuscript/figures/1xqq_spread.png
        
        Each column in Panel **(b)** describes the histogram in Ramachandran number (R) space for a single model/timeframe. These histograms show the presence of both helices (at R \~ 0.34) and sheets (at R \~ 0.52). Additionally, Panels **(c)** and **(d)** describe the per-residue conformational plots (colored by two different metrics or CMAPs), which show that most of the protein backbone remains relatively stable (e.g., few fluctuations in state or 'color' are evident over the frame \#). Finally, Panel **(e)** describes the extent towards which a single residue's state has deviated from the first frame, and Panel **(f)** describes the extent towards which a single residue's state has deviated from its state in the previous frame. Both these graphs, as expected from Panels **(c)** and **(d)**, show that this protein is relatively conformationally stable.
        
        
        Example 2: An intrinsically disordered protein (`2fft <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2FFT>`_)
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        As compared to the conformationally stable protein above, an intrinsically disordered protein `2fft <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2FFT>`_
        is much more flexible
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjanmannige/backmap/master/manuscript/manuscript/figures/2fft_spread.png
        
        Panel **(b)** shows that the states accessed per model are diverse and dramatically fluctuate over the entire range of R (this is especially true when compared to a stable protein, see above). 
        
        The diverse states occupied by each residue (Panels **(c)** and **(d)**) confirm this conformational variation within most residues (Panels **(e)** and **(f)** similarly show how most of the residues fluctuate dramatically).
        
        Yet, interestingly, Panels **(c)** through **(f)** also show an unusually stable region -- residues 15 through 25 -- which consistently display the same conformational (alpha-helical) state at R \~ 0.33 (interpreted as the color red in Panel **(c)**). This trend would be hard to recognize by simply looking at the structure (Panel **(a)**).
